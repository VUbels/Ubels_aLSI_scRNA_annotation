For this pipeline to work you need to install and run R through <R-4.4. Any other version will likely brick the code due to library incompatability. Get 3.11.9 python installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ to ensure that reticulate automatically constructs a correct virtual python environment within your project directory. Otherwise feel free to use any other python version as long as you get numpy <1.26.4 and set up a new reticulate env.
