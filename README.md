>For this pipeline to run <R-4.4. Any other version will brick due to library incompatability. Get 3.12.0+ python installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/ to ensure that reticulate automatically constructs a correct virtual python environment within your project directory. Otherwise feel free to use any other python version but ensure numpy <1.26.4 and set up a new reticulate env.
