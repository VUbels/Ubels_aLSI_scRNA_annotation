Dedicated instructions to running the Automated_Annotation pipeline:

Ensure all prerequisites are installed:

-Download and install R (4.3.2): https://www.r-project.org/ (4.4.1+ currently not supported)

-Download and install RStudio (3.3+): https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

-Download and install Python (3.12+): https://www.python.org/downloads/

For first time users, the annotation pipeline aims to provide a largely autonamous experience with only sparse user input.
Start by opening the Parameter_File.R, this can be done in a dedicated environment or simply in notepad.
Each of script SkinHF_01 to SkinHF_05 requires parameters handled in the parameter file.
Parameters are determined by the user based on the output of the previous script.

In Parameter_File.R first enter the Global Parameters and parameters for Script_01.
Each parameter is explained within the file and should present no difficulty.

Open Automate_Annotate_SkinHF_01.Rmd in your R IDE (RStudio).
Each script is written in Markdown format, such that each chunk can be ran indepedently if necessary.
Upon opening Script_01 a virtual R and Python environment are initiated.
Type Y in the console and press enter. Packages will be downloaded and installed,
note this can take quite a bit of time. After the virtual environments are set up simply select Run All with the shortcut:
Control - Alt - R.

After each script is finished running a pop-up will appear and a dedicated output folder
containing the necessary information to set up parameters for the subsequent script is generated.
